# Kernel Memory Service

[Kernel Memory](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory) provides a [Service implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/tree/main/service/Service) that can be used to manage memory settings, ingest data and query for answers. While it is a good solution, in some scenarios it can be too complex.

So, the goal of this repository is to provide a lightweight implementation of Kernel Memory as a Service. This project is quite simple, so it can be easily customized according to your needs and even integrated in existing application with little effort.
